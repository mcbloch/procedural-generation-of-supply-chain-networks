# Procedural generation of supply chain networks using a constraint based multi-agent path-finding algorithm

Or in a less buzzword sentence

> Generating a road network connecting supply and request nodes for factory like games.


Algorithm based on the paper

**Suboptimal Variants of the Conflict-Based Search Algorithm
for the Multi-Agent Pathfinding Problem** by Max Barer, Guni Sharon, Roni Stern and Ariel Felner <sup>[1]</sup>

## Intro

I'm basing myself on Factorio here as I don't have much experience of other factory games but the concepts should be applicable to similar games as well.
